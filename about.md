I'm Patrick and I am a QA Automation Engineer from Los Angeles currently working in Europe.
This blog exists for the simple reason that I want to document some of the automation issues I have
encountered that were not well documented or listed when searching the google or StackOverflow.
I am primarily going to be writing about using protractor but my background is in Java so please feel
free to email me any questions about protractor or the Java Selenium WebDriver bindings.
